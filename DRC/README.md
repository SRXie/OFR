## Installation

The implementation depends on the following commonly used packages, all of which can be installed via conda.

| Package       | Version                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| PyTorch       | â‰¥ 1.8.1                          |
| numpy         | *not specified* (we used 1.20.0) |
| opencv-python | 4.5.1.48                         |
| pandas        | 1.2.3                            |


## Datasets and Pretrained Models

Datasets and pretrained models are available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qItekRJcOYBIcVi4ChrcyzwFVl-lrw23?usp=sharing

Please follow the following commands to obtain the `CLEVR6` dataset:

```bash
# Download `clevr_with_masks_train.tfrecords` from deepmind gcloud
cd drc_workspace/scripts
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/multi-object-datasets/clevr_with_masks/clevr_with_masks_train.tfrecords
python load_clevr_with_masks.py
```
This will save the generated dataset in the `meta` folder.

## Training

```bash
# Train a foreground extractor with specified checkpoint folder
python main.py --checkpoints <TO_BE_SPECIFIED>
```

You may specify the value of arguments. Please find the available arguments in the `config.yml.example` file in `drc_workspace` folder. 

Note that `DATA` indicates the dataset to use (`CUB`, `DOG`, `CAR`, `CLEVR` and `TEXTURED`). The path to your dataset folder, i.e., `ROOT_DIR`, needs to be specified before running the script.

## Testing

```bash
# Evaluate the extractor
python test.py --checkpoints <TO_BE_SPECIFIED>
```
